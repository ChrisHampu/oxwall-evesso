EVE SSO plugin for the Oxwall open source social network software.

Based heavily off of the Facebook Connect Oxwall plugin.

Supports connecting to the EVE API using an admin-defines set of EVE developer keys, allowing SSO and Crest/XML API integration.
When an account is created using SSO, the users' profile shows basic information about their EVE character: Corporation, Alliance, and Character Name.
